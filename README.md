# Terraform Module Template

This repository serves as a **template** for creating reusable and well-structured **terraform modules**.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

The following structure provides a clear organization of the **terraform module**.

```plaintext

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ release.yaml       # GitHub Actions workflow to create release.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CODEOWNERS             # Defines required reviewers (DevSecOps team).
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ setup/                 # Setup module for testing.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf            # Terraform configuration for setup tests.

â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                 # Git ignored files.
â”œâ”€â”€ .pre-commit-config.yaml    # Pre-commit hooks for linting and validation.
â”œâ”€â”€ .releaserc.json            # Semantic release configuration.
â”œâ”€â”€ .trivyignore               # List of errors to be ignored by Trivy.
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf                    # Main terraform module.
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf                 # Defines outputs for the module.
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf                # Provider configuration.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To use this template, clone the repository and customize the module as needed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gucasassi/terraform-module.git
cd terraform-module
```

To ensure code quality and consistency, this repository uses `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks.

### Install pre-commit

Before you can run hooks, you need to have the pre-commit package manager installed.

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Install Commitizen

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Guide

This repository follows a structured workflow to ensure **code quality, security, and consistency**. Below is the recommended process to work together.

### 1 - Create new branch

Follow the **GitHub flow** practice.

```bash
git switch -c feature/my-new-feature
```

Use descriptive branch names `feature`, `fix`, `chore`, `etc`.

### 2 - Make changes and commit

Once the necessary changes are made, use **commitizen** to create a commit that follows **conventional commits**.

```bash
cz
```

Or manually:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for new authentication method"
```

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips:

- Please use [atomic commits](https://dev.to/samuelfaure/how-atomic-git-commits-dramatically-increased-my-productivity-and-will-increase-yours-too-4a84).
- Write [good commits](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) message.
- Please always use lowercase in commit messages.

### 3 - Push & Pull Request

Push your branch to the repository.

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

Then, open a **Pull Request**, A DevSecOps team member will review it.
